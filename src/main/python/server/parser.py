    This class parses incoming requests and builds a clip object from them.

    The headers specified in ACCEPTED_HEADERS can and will be simply read
    and their content put into the clip-object with the key being stripped of
    the leading X-C2-. The database itself will not validate any keys or
    values and just save the clip object as-is, so validation should happen
    here.
    If a header needs special treatment, the appropriate logic has to be added
    in the method get_data_from_request and not into the list below.
    Currently, the only other header is X-C2-download_request. This header
    promts the parser to treat the payload of the request as an URL to a media
    type like an image for example and to download the target of the URL.
    This is used by the Chrome-Extension because it cannot send binary data
    itself.
