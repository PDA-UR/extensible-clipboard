# Extensible Clipboard
This is the improved repository of Extensible Clipboard, 
which has been initially developed by Matthias R√∂sl. 

Extensible Clipboard is a web-transparent extension of the
traditional system clipboard, enabling users enhanced functionality 
and the capability to create own applications, tapping into 
the functionality of the system clipboard.

üö® Running extensible clipboard is currently [not supported on OS X platforms](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57844285/qapplication-clipboard-datachanged-not-work-in-background) due to 
restrictions of the PyQT framework. 

## Features
- üåè  Remotely set the clipboard on multiple systems via HTTP-Requests

- ‚è≥ Access the clipboard history via HTTP-Requests

- üìã Full portation of clipboard functionality to REST-interface ([Read the doc here...](./../../wiki/API-Documentation)
)

- üîí Control access to your clipboard by whitelisting clients

## Installation
Installation requires python3.7+, as well as pip on your system. Installation on Linux also requires ```make``` to be installed.

### ... on Linux
Execute ```make``` in project root.

### ... on Windows
Execute ```win_install.bat``` in project root.

## Running 

### ... on Linux
Execute ```make run``` in project root.

### ... on Windows
Execute ```win_run.bat``` in project root.
It's easy as that!

## Configuring 


### Server Whitelist
The clip/backend server will only accept requests from trusted clipboards. Trusted clipboards
can be defined in ExtensibleClipboard/config/trusted-clients-config.json: Simply add the
IPv4 address of your clipboard device to the list to allow access to the clipboard.

### System
You can adapt extensible clipboard to your needs and workflows by changing the config files 
or passing command line arguments. The following commands will demonstrate some possible 
use cases, that we have encountered

#### Full package
For deploying the complete system with server and clipboard, simply run:

    # Start extensible clipboard full environment
    cd ./servers
    'target/ExtensibleClipboard/ExtensibleClipboard'

#### Server only
For only running a server, enter:

    # Start extensible clipboard server
    cd ./servers
    'target/ExtensibleClipboard/ExtensibleClipboard' -nocbs

This may come in handy, if you want to offer a centralized, remote server.

#### Clipboard only
For only running the clipboard, enter:

    # Start extensible clipboard, clipboard-only
    cd ./servers
    'target/ExtensibleClipboard/ExtensibleClipboard' -nocs -cbsdomain=http://mydomain -cbsport=12345 -cshost=http://myserverdomain:12345/

This configuration is suitable for setups, where you might connect your local 
clipboard to a remote server.
